# Conclusion

The knowledge of commuting stress in both psychological context and travel behavior studies is of importance as it tends to have a significant impact on daily patterns of commute. This thesis focuses on analysis of the interaction between urban movements, daily commute, stress feelings towards the travel experiences and their reaction.

Chapter contributes to construct a comprehensive foundation into the format of a data package including a wide variety aspects of living and moving in urban environment. As it has been indicated earlier, people may have different travel experience in terms of perceiving stress and assigning importance to the negative feeling regarding their occupation, age, income and the mode of transportation choice. Second  paper includes modelling techniques to understand the interaction between our outcome and exploratory variables to identify how commuters based on different categories are affected and what coping strategies can be applied to them.

In the following sections of this chapter, the mentioned contributions will be discussed in depth along with policy implication of the research, study limitations and further research.

## Research Contribution

Research primarily aimed at exploring travel behavior and commuting stress on a daily basis. This thesis also contributes to understanding the copings strategies that may have been used by commuters.

### Providing a data package based on travel behavior of Santiaguinos commuters.

The research has collected a broad range of information based on a large-scale travel survey. This package is a valuable resource as it has been purposefully collected, helpful to understand travel behavior and urban experiences including residential context, demographic information, built environment, work commute behaviors and health and feelings information. The psychological part of the survey helps investigating the mental impacts of travels and health outcomes. This information gives beneficial insights into transportation planning, public sector development and health-related policies. 

### Influential attributes in commuting stress experiences

Findings based on the bivariate ordinal regression model suggested that people may have different feelings from happiness and excitement to anxiety and stress according to various socio-demographic situations such as different age groups, occupations, income levels and  the primary mode of transport choice. In terms of importance of understanding the possible stressors [@useche2023another] found that while commuters encounter daily negative commute experiences such as traffic jams, deficiencies in transport choices, crowded public transport services, prolonged trips, and road conflicts, there are not much studies that have methodologically addressed the issue of commuting stress (CS). Findings of the current study have indicated that mostly pertaining to lower levels of income, young age range, using public modes may cause people to feel more stress while considering not enough importance to that feeling.

### Potential coping strategies

According to the results from the modelling process and exploring the previous studies in terms of the ways that people deal with stress, concept of normalization as an emotion-based coping strategy has been indicated to be employed by commuters. As indicated earlier almost more than half of Santiaguinos are related to middle income and low income and had limited transportation options. As [@chen2017travel] found, work-related travels may be integrated with stress and this negative feeling of travelers can be rationalized and adjusted leading to normalization. In fact, business travelers may experience different level of stress than leisure commuters and they know how to develop their strategies to normalize the stress that they are facing with. Hence, understanding various aspects of work commuters’ stressors is important to address their issue associated with commuting stress.

## Policy Implications

### Invest in Public Transport Infrastructure

As the results from the modelling process of this dissertation have indicated, almost more than half of the respondents were characterized as middle-income and low-income people who relied on using public mode of transport for daily work commute. The findings also have revealed that although youth age range are the most stress affected commuters out of this people, they did not care about feeling of stress as they were assumed to be. Following this issue, enhancement in public transportation infrastructure could be considered as a crucial policy implication in research. According to commuters’ experiences, having access to a more reliable, efficient, and comfortable public transportation can reduce the stress associated with commuting, especially for those who rely on it such as younger people from middle-income and low-income groups in this research. There for policy makers should consider that investments in public transit can lead to reduced congestion, shorter commute times, and a more positive and satisfying commuting experience.

### Promote Alternative Transportation Modes

The results of the thesis suggested that active transport modes like walking or cycling is the least popular mode in Santiago. It is interesting that this mode is mostly used by low-income categories who are more conscious of the importance of stress, but experience relatively lower stress levels as opposed to those from the same group but with high stress and interested in public mode. As similar Chilean studies like [@herrmann2020persistence] have shown the unpopularity of active transportation can be attributed to safety concerns, including sexual harassment, and a lack of safe infrastructure. Thus, encouraging the use of alternative and healthy transport modes like cycling and walking, and even carpooling would be another key policy implication. These modes can reduce the stress of daily commuting, help to promote physical activity, and contribute to environmental sustainability. Hence, policies that create safe and convenient options for active transportation can significantly impact commuters' well-being and reduce commuting stress.

## Further Research

The research analyzed the impact of stress on commuters on a daily basis by investigating the interaction among experienced stress, importance of that and socio-demographic variables to understand the relevant coping strategies to address this issue. However, there are some other research questions needed further attention.

### Exploring Cross-Cultural impacts on travel patterns and commuting stress

Understanding the cross-cultural differences in commuting stress and coping strategies can be helpful in studying how individuals in different cultural contexts experience and manage their stress associated with their daily commutes. Furthermore, it can be explored whether various cultural factors, such as societal norms and lifestyles, values, and communication styles, influence how people perceive and cope with commuting stress. For instance, [@balbontin2021impact] has investigated the cross-cultural comparisons using data in eight countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and South Africa). They explored the incidence of remote working post-COVID-19 and what impact this could have on the number of weekly commuting trips. Therefore, exploring the changes in travel behavior and commuting stress due to various reasons and in different cultural context would be beneficial in understanding and prediction of new trends. 

### The Role of Technology in Commuting

According to the literature review in this research, people differ from employing a technique to deal with their stressful experience of commuting. Some of them may take an advantage of problem-focused and other ones would be interested in using emotion-focused coping strategies. As a result, further research area could investigate the role of technology in modern commuting experiences, including the impact of digital gadgets and interventions in the way that people deal with the negative feeling when traveling. Regarding the increasing use of technology in daily life, understanding commuters’ interactions with these digital tools during the travel is of importance. As [@holden2018technology] has pointed out while stress can have negative effect on work-life balance, technology would have an improving role on that. For example, people can undertake their job responsibilities using a phone, avoid commuting stress, allocating their time to other activities and managing both work and life commitments in a more flexible way.

### Impacts of Environmental Factors on Commuting Experiences

According to the Santiago data set as a foundation for further analysis, sections of built environment and nature and sustainability of the city people reveal different viewpoints about the effect of physical environment of commuting routes and individuals' experiences during their commutes. Investigating an appropriate way to manage the problem of stress requires further research and development of appropriate interventions. As [@rowden2011relative] have suggested, interventions may aim at environmental factors such as traffic congestion, mitigating stress responses (e.g., work-related stress management programs), or enhancing the driver's ability to cope with challenges during the commute.

## Study Limitations

There are some main limitations in this study should be considered. First there was a shortage in stress specific and objective stressors variables in our data set such as speed, level of traffic congestion, commute starting and ending times, commute duration  and so on. Having comprehensive collected data can provide a better understanding of how commuting stress affects commuters and what type of coping strategies they tend to employ.

Second is lack of variation in coping strategy identification in terms of introducing specific coping strategies regarding each mode of transportation. As the research focused on the most affect group of people who were public transport commuters, other significant modes like private ones were excluded while public commuters had negative feelings of stress during their commute. 

Third one is related to the collection date of data set used as a foundation for the second paper. The survey conducted a couple of years ago when there was no impact of COVID-19 on travel behavior of Santiaguinos. COVID-19 has significant impacts in terms of changing travel patterns as a notable portion of people have transitioned to remote job or some other have reduced their dependency on using public transportation. Therefore, incorporating COVID-19 related variables will be helpful in providing a more accurate insight into travel behavior and health and safety concerns.

## Closing remarks

This thesis aimed at investigating the effect of stress on commuting experience of motorized and non motorized commuters and how they address their negative feelings.  As study has indicated understanding mode of transport choice and income level would be important as these variables have impact on the stress level during the commute. Public transport users, who are mostly low-income individuals, experience the highest levels of commuting stress. This category of commuters seems to be more resilient to stress, perhaps because of the necessity of using public transport regarding their financial status despite its drawbacks. In contrast, private transport users who are mainly high-income, also face substantial stress, indicating that higher income does not necessarily mean to experience a stress-free commuting. [@evans2002morning] also pointed an interesting explanation about role of the degree of predictability as a salient contributor to commuting stress in commuter mode selection. Perhaps private mode users are more interested in using their own vehicle than public means of transportation because they feel more predictability than mass transit options.

Thesis also has investigated the role of normalization as a coping mechanism. The concept of "limited horizons" and normalization appear as a well-fitted coping mechanism. Low-income commuters, despite undergoing high stress levels, reveal a level of adaptation or normalization, possibly resulting from their reliance on public transport. This normalization process has been indicated to be beneficial for them to deal with daily stressors associated with commuting.

Age as another influential demographic characteristics on stress perception has been reviewed in this study. Younger commuters, especially those relying on public transport, have reported the highest stress levels but have assigned the least importance to their negative feelings. This generation seems to be more resilient or indifferent to commuting stress comparing to their counterparts. Contrastingly, adults as a category who are primarily using private transport, have undergone less stress but they have prioritized addressing it, revealing a greater concern for their well-being.

These findings emphasize the complex interaction among socioeconomic factors, mode of transport choice, and stress perception in the context of daily commuting. Furthermore, the importance of considering psychological aspects and adhering to them as coping strategies, such as normalization has been indicated when it comes to designing policies and interventions to enhance commuting experiences and feelings. Understanding these dynamics can inform policymakers and transportation planners as they work towards creating a more equitable, efficient, and less stressful transportation systems. For instance, [@smith2017commute] has indicated that policymakers should continue make active travel options more available as people feel more happier commuting by bike or walk. Future research could delve deeper into the decent coping mechanisms employed by different commuter groups and explore how these findings can be used in other global contexts.
